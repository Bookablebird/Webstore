# WebStore is an imaginary web store, created by Paavo Helin(me), Jori HÃ¤nninen and Vladimir Gavrilov.
This project was for the course "Web-tekniikat"(Web technologies) at Metropolia, University of applied sciences.

# *Notice*
This project was done as a group, and I can not take full credit for it. 
I did most of the design work and a big part of the general functioning of the project, but only a little of the php/db related stuff.
